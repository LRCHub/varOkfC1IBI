I wake up just to find the empty space
I try to get to sleep again, and imagine you're here
I thought I heard you whispering my name
I try to reach my arms to you
But you're not there

Then I realize it's just a dream
I have to face another day, the night is over
Sun shines through my window now I see
I have to face the truth again, that you're really gone

How should l know why everything's the same?
When I can't hold you, kiss you, hear you say you love me too
There's no way that I could erase all the memories of you
I keep inside, all of the time
Cause they show how I'm still in love with you
Your love's forever

Everytime I close my eyes
I can see you by my side
Tell me baby, what else can I do?
It doesn't bother me at all
How many seasons fall
You'll always be here in my heart

If you ever asked me to someday
Maybe I'd be strong enough to get over you
I'd rather spend my nights and my days
With all the pain and the regret
Just crying over you

How should I understand how life goes on?
Without you I won't last a day
Remember how we used to pray
I wish that I could just forget and set my heart free
Although I tried, I don't know why
I'm falling deeper in love with you
I wish forever

Everytime I close my eyes
I can see you by my side
Tell me baby, what else can I do?
It doesn't bother me at all
How many seasons fall
You'll always be here in my heart

(My love, miss you so much)
(Don't wanna ever let you go)
('Cause you're my everything)

Your love's forever

Everytime I close my eyes
I can see you by my side
Tell me baby, what else can I do?
It doesn't bother me at all
How many seasons fall
You'll always be here in my heart

I close my eyes and try to find
The traces of your love so kind
Tell me baby, what else can I do?
Love will never fade away
That's just what you say
I know we'll never be apart

You'll always be here in my heart
